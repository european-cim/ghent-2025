    "text": "About EuroCIM\nThe general theme of the meeting is “Causal Inference in Health, Economic and Social Sciences”. Causal inference is broadly defined, and the focus is on statistical methodology and challenging applications that highlight necessary methodological extensions.\n\nEuroCIM aims to provide a forum for people interested in causal inference to meet informally, for early career and established researchers to present and discuss the latest developments in the field, and to offer opportunities for networking to develop future research opportunities and collaborations.\nEuroCIM evolved from what used to be the “UK Causal Inference Meetings” (UK-CIM). The EuroCIM steering committee consists of Alessandra Mattei, Rhian Daniel, Erin Gabriel, Fabrizia Mealli, Finbarr Leacy, Jon Michael Gran, Karla Diaz-Ordaz, Kate Tilling, Kjetil Roysland, Mats Stensrud, Niels Richard Hansen, Noemi Kreif, Oliver Dukes, Paul Clarke, Richard Emsley, Sara Geneletti, Sabine Landau, Michele Santacatterina, Stephen Burgess, and Vanessa Didelez.\n\nPlease note that registration for the meeting is not restricted to people from Europe, and we welcome participation from anyone who would like to attend!"

The emphasis is on giving enough background on the basic ideas so that the Euro-CIM meeting can be enjoyed without feeling lost. The material covered might therefore change slightly once the final programme for the meeting is known, but is likely to include:\n\nthe different languages of causality, e.g. do-notation, potential outcomes\nhow these languages express causal effects\nthe sorts of assumptions often relied upon to identify causal effects, and the meaning of identification\ngraphical models used in causal inference, including DAGs and SWIGs\nregression models as causal models\nmethods based on the propensity score\ninstrumental variable methods, including Mendelian randomisation\nsustained exposures and time-varying confounders\ntarget trial emulation\nmediation analysis\n\nThe fact that the list above is far too long for a one-day course gives an impression of the nature of the workshop - rather than dwell on all the intricacies of the various methods and approaches, and how one might apply them in practice using computer packages, the focus will instead be on imparting the main ideas before moving swiftly on to the next topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRhian Daniel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nErin Gabriel"

The idea of ‘target trial emulation’ was set out and popularised by Hernan and Robins (2016) in their paper on “Using Big Data to Emulate a Target Trial When a Randomized Trial Is Not Available” (AJE), though similar approaches had been used earlier. Trial emulation is increasingly used across a range of clinical areas to answer questions that would not be feasible in a randomized trial or to enhance evidence from randomized trials.\nThe trial emulation approach starts with specifying a protocol for a ‘target trial’ – the trial we would like to conduct if it were feasible - and then emulating each element of the target trial using observational data. Trial emulation incorporates principles of study design combined with an analysis that accounts for the lack of randomization to treatment within the observational data. This course will discuss how we can use trial emulation to help us to: formulate sensible and precise causal questions, avoid common biases that can occur through study design and analysis steps, facilitate communication between different experts involved during a study. A range of examples will be discussed covering different types of treatment strategies, data sources, and clinical areas. The focus will not be on details of statistical analysis, but we will touch on different methods that have been used in practice, emphasising that trial emulation is not restricted to any particular statistical analysis method. We hope that at the end of the course participants will have built confidence in designing and implementing target trial emulation studies.\n\n\n\nRuth Keogh\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon – A Gentle Introduction to Targeted Learning, by Antoine Chambaz (Université Paris Cité)\nLocation: Auditorium 2, Ledeganck\nStart time: 13:30 with a coffee break in the afternoon\nCoined by van der Laan and Rubin in 2006, further developed and championed by a global community of researchers, targeted learning is a data analysis methodology that bridges causal analysis, statistics and machine learning. It emphasizes the estimation of well-defined target parameters while leveraging flexible machine learning techniques to ensure robust and interpretable results.\nThe methodology is detailed in two seminal books co-edited by Rose and van der Laan in 2011 and 2018. They serve as foundational texts, offerring both theoretical insights and practical guidance for implementing targeted learning in real-world settings.\nIn this lesson, I will present the main ideas behind targeted learning and demonstrate how to operationalize them.\n\n\n\nAntoine Chambaz"

    "text": "How to get to\n\nThe venue from the Gent-Sint-Pieters train station:\nIt is a 10-min walk from the Gent-Sint-Pieters train station. Follow Koningin Astridlaan to Citadel Park. Walk through or along the edge of the Citadel Park to the ICC. When you get there, cross over Emile Clauslaan. On your right, you will find the entrance to the Botanical Garden. The conference takes place in the building in front of you. Please enter the building via the Karel Lodewijk Ledeganckstraat.\n\n\nThe venue from the historical city centre:\nIt’s about a 30-min walk from Korenmarkt (near Saint Nicholas’ Church). Along the way, you’ll pass not only historic churches but also the Wintercircus - a unique building worth a visit, the main Ghent University Building (Ufo), Sint-Pietersplein, a large but rarely used square. You’ll also walk through the Student district (Overpoortstraat) and past two of Ghent most renowned museums, SMAK and MSK.\nPublic transport will take about 25min. Take buses 5A/5B (from stop Sint-Jacobs to stop Ottergemsesteenweg), bus 55 (from stop Sint-Jacobs to stop Ledeganckstraat) or buses 55/70/71/76/77 (from stop Zuid to stop Ledeganckstraat). You can plan your journey by bus or tram at delijn.be.\n\n\nGent-Sint-Pieters train station from Brussels Airport:\nWe recommend traveling by train from Brussels Airport. This should take less than an hour. For the fastest route, take the train towards Knokke, as the direct train to Gent-Sint-Pieters makes frequent stops and takes much longer. Since the Knokke train runs only once per hour, another option is to first take a train to Brussels-South and then transfer to a train heading towards Blankenberge or Oostende. Get off at Gent-Sint-Pieters train station.\nA taxi will take about an hour, but will be much more expensive (&gt;100 euros).\n\n\nGent-Sint-Pieters train station from Brussels-South train station:\nTake a train heading towards Blankenberge or Oostende. Get off at Gent-Sint-Pieters train station."

We can take some action (and improve our travel experience!) by travelling to EuroCIM by train. Here’s how…\nGhent is well-connected by train, and can be reached in less than 8 hours from many parts of Europe. The University travel site gives more details (https://www.ugent.be/en/ghentuniv/mission/sustainability/guidelines/travel), and information about trains. Travel times include:\n\n&lt;2 hours from Paris, Lille, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, other stations within The Netherlands and Belgium.\n2-4 hours from Germany (Bonn, Dortmund, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, central France (Lyon, Strasbourg), Luxembourg, Utrecht, London.\n4-6 hours from UK (Birmingham, Bristol, Cambridge, Manchester, Oxford), France (e.g. Montpellier, Bordeaux), Germany (Stuttgart, Bremen)\n6-8 hours from Germany (Berlin, Hamburg, Munich), France (Nice), Toulouse), UK (Cardiff, Durham, Edinburgh, Newcastle), Switzerland (Basel, Bern, Geneva, Zurich).\n\n\nCompare your train journey to flying here:\nhttps://www.ecopassenger.org/bin/query.exe/en?L=vs_uic\nCarbon footprint in EU is approx. 7 metric tons of Carbon per person (=7000 kg).\n\nFrom the UK:\nRail. Total duration of journey (London to Ghent) approx. 4 hours (including 1 hour check in for Eurostar). Total cost approx. £220. Carbon footprint = 2kg (one-way)\nFlight. 1 hr duration (plus 1 hour recommended check in at Heathrow – also would need to factor in travel to Heathrow). Total cost &gt;£250. To Ghent from airport – train - &lt;1 hour. Plus time to get off plane, through security, find train. Total time approx. 4 hours. Carbon footprint = 121.4kg (one-way).\nSaving (return)= 238.8kg\n\n\n\nOffsetting\nIt is estimated that a mature tree can absorb about 25kg of CO2 per year (https://ecotree.green/en/) – so 10 trees would be needed for a year to offset this flight (and this does not include other issues such as pollution, other emissions, etc)."
